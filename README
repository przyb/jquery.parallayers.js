Parallayers gives you simple solution to create parallax effect bound to mouse movement.
It's extremally lightweight - 3kb minified! Oh yeah.
To start using it, create some relative or absolute positioned div, and fill it with layers.
Each layer should be absolutely positioned block element, such as div, having class called "layer".
For example - some markup:

<div id="parallax-wrapper">
	<div class="layer layer-1"></div>
	<div class="layer layer-2"></div>
	<div class="layer layer-3"></div>
<div>

and CSS:
#parallax-wrapper { width: 600px; height: 450px; position: relative; }
.layer { width: 600px; height: 450px; position: absolute; }

Now you can apply parallayers on it. Simpliest example is:

$('#parallax-wrapper').parallayers({
	'layer-1' : { x : -25, y : -5 },
	'layer-2' : { x : 0, y : 0 },
	'layer-3' : { x : 25, y : 5 }
});

Possible options for layer are:
x - max horizontal movement (in pixels)
y - max vertical movement (in pixels)

Parallayers is also 3d transforms enabled. Since css 3d transforms are not bundled out-of-box in jquery,
it is dependant on jquery.transit.js - cute piece of code, which enables css transforms and transitions
in jquery. And it's 2kb minified :) Transit is available here: http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
With transit attached, additional layer options are:
rotateX - layer rotation over X axis
rotateY - layer rotation over Y axis
rotateZ - layer rotation over Z axis (similar to css3 "rotate()")
Notice, that css 3d transforms are available currently only on newest versions of Gecko
and Webkit based browsers.

More features are covered in "demos".
